      - Hello...0
      - 'Why hello there! Might you be here to visit Uranus?


        You are in
        luck, because your search ends here. You are speaking to the one and only.1'
    - row:
      - "DON\u2019T! YOU! SAY IT!\_\nImbecile, I\u2019ll have you know I carry the
        namesake of a deity of the great skies! If you would make it your laughing
        stock then you may see yourself out!1"
      - "I\u2019m sorry. I am so sorry.1"
      - (Uranus collects themself for a moment)2
      - Thank you. That farce is a low-hanging fruit, and a rotten one at that. Many
        folks innocently pick at it, unknowing of the irritation it causes me.1
      - Furthermore, I must apologize for the immediate outburst. Might we restart
        on the right foot?1
      - Uh, yeah. Sorry again.0
      - Wonderful. Then, I am Uranus, the glimpse of blue sky that stands out against
        the void of dark space, and the pioneer of axial tilt.1
      - Who might you be?1
    - row:
      - Of course you do! I am the pioneer of the tilted look. I am the glimpse of
        blue sky that stands out confidently against the dark void of vacuum.1
      - "I\u2019m not like the other planets, nor even the other ice giants \u2013
        folks would trek for countless astronomical units just to meet me! That is
        the reason you have come here, is it not?1"
      - "Um\u2026 Yeah, I wanted to\u2026 chat with you.0"
      - Oh, splendid! Conversing with others does bring me such joy.1
      - Might you be interested in the fluid dynamics of methane and hydrogen under
        pressure? Or, if that is a bit much, have you any interest in theistic philosophy?1
      - huh?0
      - My apologies. Just some impassioned interests escaping.1
      - So, what shall we discuss, other than advanced subjects? Would you perhaps
        like to tell me about yourself?1
    - row: []
    - row:
      - uh...0
      - "I\u2019m, er, I was\u2026 you\u2019d know me as Earth\u2019s moon\u20260"
      - "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Earth\u2019s Moon! What else brings
        you to the outskirts of our lovely system \u2013 other than a visit?1"
    - row:
      - "I\u2019m, er, I was\u2026 you\u2019d know me as Earth\u2019s moon\u20260"

    - row:
      - uh, like you said... to meet you...0
      - Oh, how charming! Well, meet me you have. Thus, your quest is surely complete.1
      - '[Ariel] Hey Uranus?1'
      - Ariel, hello! Would you like to meet our visitor?1
      - '[Ariel] Actually, I came to say, is there something you may be forgetting
        about?1'
      - My word, you are correct! Please let the other moons know I will arrive shortly.1
      - "Apologies, Earth\u2019s Moon, I must leave. I am late for group trivia night!\nThanks
        for the chat, kind stranger! Ciao!1"
      - (Uranus departs to be with their moons.)2
    - row:
      - uh, just... looking around...0
      - A worthy endeavor! Despite the relative lack of light, there is much to see
        in our part of the system!1
      - You could meet Neptune and Pluto. The pair of them are not terribly accustomed
        to guests, but they are good folks, deep down.1
      - You could also visit the Kuiper belt. Sadly, Eris is not around as of late,
        however I do hear that there are some lovely comets about instead!1
