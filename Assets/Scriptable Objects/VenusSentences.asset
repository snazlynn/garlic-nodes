      - Well hello, darling.1

        rock something real exciting must have gone down.1"
    - row:
      - "Who? I don\u2019t know any earth.0"
      - Oh, darling, I already know who you are, no need to be so evasive.1
      - "Judging by your craters you\u2019re not very good at it in the first place.1"
      - "Anyways, if you\u2019re here on my orbit you\u2019re here on business.1"
      - So what business brought you to me, my cratered little friend?1
    - row:
      - Oh, uh, yeah, we broke up.0
      - "Goodness, really?!? I can\u2019t imagine why that would be.1"
      - (He knows. He definitely knows.)0
      - "Anyways, if you\u2019re here on my orbit you\u2019re here on business.1"

      - I wanted to know more about the other planets.0
      - "Since I\u2019m not really, uh....well traveled?0"
      - "Of course, of course, darling. I assume you want some profiles on yor potential
        new orbiting prospects? I\u2019ll give you the rundown.1"
      - "Let\u2019s see....Mercury\u2019s a shallow little wretch, but dedicated
        nonetheless. Although, to catch his eyes you\u2019d need to shine brighter
        than the sun.1"
      - "Earth is...well, you know. I can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d ever orbit
        him to begin with.1"
      - "If you were interested in getting back with him again after the humans are
        gone, don\u2019t bother. He\u2019s tried that whole yellowstone business
        before already.1"
      - "It didn\u2019t work, if you were wondering.1"
      - "Mars is a kind fellow, not a bad choice for any would-be orbiters. Of course,
        that doesn\u2019t apply to company he keeps.1"
      - Phobos and Deimos are ravenous little monsters, if I may say so.1
      - "Jupiter\u2019s not bad, but his moons are even worse than Mars. I\u2019d
        say more if they wouldn\u2019t try to eat me alive when I do.1"
      - Saturn is a similar case. Very similar, actually. Down to both being vain
        about their special little traits.1
      - "Oh, that reminds me. That spot Jupiter\u2019s so proud of? I think it\u2019s
        malignant.1"
      - "Uranus should be avoided at all costs. I don\u2019t know what his moons
        see in him.1"
      - "Really, it\u2019s a miracle he even counts as a planet at all. They really
        should update those requirements at NASA.1"
      - Neptune is....well nothing, really. And I do mean nothing. He could be a
        black hole if he wanted with that personality.1
      - "That\u2019s about all there is to everyone. The sun\u2019s off limits for
        someone like you so I won\u2019t bother.1"
      - What about pluto?0
      - "Pluto? Please, you\u2019re looking to BE a moon, not get one.1"
      - "Even if Pluto accepts you, you\u2019d be miserable. He is, at least.1"
      - "So caught up with that whole \u201Cdwarf planet\u201D business. I doubt
        he even knows why he\u2019s excluded.1"

    - row:
      - "I\u2019m looking to orbit a new planet.0"
      - Well, certainly not me, I hope.1
      - I have standards.1
      - "But I do know some lovely neighborhood fellows who\u2019d be just perfect
        for you! Minus some potential, ah, availability conflicts.1"
